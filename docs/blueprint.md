## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3498db), evoking feelings of trust and reliability, which is very valuable for an application like this.
- Background color: Dark navy (#2c3e50) to maintain focus on data presented by the application.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#9b59b6), which has good contrast to the primary color while also being analogous to it.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif for a modern and objective look that does not distract the user from the presented data.
- Use a set of consistent and modern icons for navigation and actions, to present key features clearly. A matching style will reinforce clarity, as well.
- Maintain a clean and well-organized layout to avoid overwhelming the user with financial data. Make use of charts where appropriate.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as loading animations or visual cues on data updates. Avoid distracting, excessive animations.
